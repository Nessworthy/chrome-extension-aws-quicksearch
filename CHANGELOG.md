## [1.2.1] - 2020-09-20

Looking at bug fixes and cleanup, finally found out why the shortcuts weren't working in EC2 ðŸ™Œ. 

### Added

- Add a security policy to the repo (doesn't affect the package).

### Changed

- Stop fiddling with event cancelling during region navigation.
- Remove unused `folder-hash` npm package in the build process (doesn't affect the package).

## [1.2.0] - 2020-09-19

Breaking changes in this one - now using <kbd>Alt</kbd>, from <kbd>Shift</kbd>, and added support for a help popup.

### Added

- Add shortcut list and introductory message as a page action.
- Add shortcut to trigger account menu (<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>)
- Add shortcut to trigger support menu (<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>)

- Ignore npm modules in the repo (doesn't affect the package).
- Include a signature in the manifest file on build (does not affect package functionality).

hasn't been created yet.
