# Changelog

## Next Release

Looking at region filter support for the old UI.

### Additions

* Adds region filter / navigation support for the old UI.
Still a little buggy on the current region element.

### Changes

* Adds a dumb 100ms start timer for the region observer - this is due to AWS' new UI not loading the
region dropdown immediately.

## 1.0.2

Focus around the build pipeline. No extension changes.

### Additions
* New build scripts, manifest fields now based on `package.json`.

### Changes
* Extension source moved to `src/`.
* Readme updated for building.
* Changelog reformatted.
* Extension size trimmed down due to addition of build scripts.

## 1.0.1

No changes - just README updates :-).

## 1.0.0

Initial release. Hello world!
