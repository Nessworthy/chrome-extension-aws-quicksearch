## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the strange event that there's security issues or concerns with this plugin, please send details to sean@nessworthy.me directly.

I'm just one dude, but I endeavour to confirm and fix any vulnerabilities as soon as possible.

If a situation arises where I cannot fix an issue in the immediate / short term, I will happily pull this plugin
from the Chrome store until the issue is resolved.
